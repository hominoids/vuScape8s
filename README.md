## vuScape8s

Integrated Odorid-Vu8s Case with either Odorid-M2 or Odorid-M1s and UPS.

### Introduction

The vuScape8s is the next generation in the vuScape series and incorporates several new features for Hardkernel’s 15th anniversary and celebratory release of the Odroid-M1s and version 2 incorporated the Odroid-M2. Thanks to the Vu8S, this is the thinnest vuScape yet and can also integrate the optional M1s-UPS accessory in landscape or portrait orientation with the Odroid-M1s.

### Features
- Odroid-M1S or Odroid-M2
- Supports all Landscape and Portrait Orientations e.g. standard, left, right, inverted
- Viewing Angle 10-23 Degrees
- Adjustable Bottom Clearance Bracket Height
- Corner Mount Hardware Selection (insert, nut, recessed, thru hole)
- Selectable SBC Cooling (fan, vent, top cover openings)
- Selectable GPIO Openings
- HK OEM Case Support
- UPS Integration, Side or Bottom (M1S Only)
- UPS External Power Button (M1S Only)
- UPS LED Accent Down Lighting (M1S Only)
- Customizer GUI

All case covers were designed so they can be removed without disturbing the mounted SBC or UPS. The orientation of the stand brackets can also be changed without any other disassembly and for the M1s, the power button on the back of the UPS can be used to power up the unit when it is off. The Odroid-M2 also has a power button on the case cover.

### BOM
-  LCD Shell and Brackets (4)M3x14mm and (4) M3x4mm inserts or M3 nuts
-  Back Frame (4) M3x6mm Countersink Screws
-  SBC mount (4) M3x4mm inserts and (4) M3x4mm Cap Screws
-  SBC Cover or OEM Case (4) M3x4mm inserts and (4) M3x4mm Cap Screws

### Build Notes
The landscape and portrait brackets need to be printed using solid fill, and most likely with a wide brim, but the back frame can use a partial fill.  Obviously inserts need only be installed in the locations being used on the frame.  Regarding the LCD panel encasement, it is important not to over tighten the mount screws because they will impose extraneous light on the front of the LCD from the pressure.  If you see light around the edges loosen the nearest screw(s) until it disappears.  I tighten them until they seat and then loose them until there is no play in the assembly, what I would describe as taut, it just holds it closed but doesn’t apply pressure.

The SBC cover spacing is the same as the HK OEM Case which can be used instead of the direct mounted SBC and cover.
