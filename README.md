## vuScape8s

Integrated Odorid-Vu8s, Odorid-m1s and UPS case

### Introduction

The vuScape8s is the next generation in the vuScape series and incorporates several new features for Hardkernelâ€™s 15th anniversary and celebratory release of the Odroid-M1s. Thanks to the Vu8S and M1S, this is the thinnest vuScape yet and can also integrate the optional M1s-UPS accessory in landscape or portrait orientation.
